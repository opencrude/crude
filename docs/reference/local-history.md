# Local History

> Status: Current reference — immutable workspace snapshots, operation-scoped agent undo and precondition-checked restore.

## Storage and recovery

- Atomic publication has one shared low-level owner: `fileio.CommitAtomicFile`.
  Local History stages and syncs its own files, then delegates replacement and
  platform durability. Unix keeps rename plus parent-directory fsync; Windows
  uses write-through replacement, never `Sync` on a read-only directory handle
  or a delete-then-rename fallback. Real permission/write/commit errors propagate
  and still abort tracked turns before provider or tool execution.
- Startup recovery reads only manifests/plans missing from the SQLite index.
  Snapshot identity and entries commit atomically; never replay all historical
  entries on open. LoadManifest/LoadPlan still verify immutable data on use.
- `localhistory.Store` owns immutable objects/manifests/plans and SQLite index
  metadata. `workspace.LocalHistoryService` owns watcher lifecycle, settings,
  message scopes, reconciliation, and restore suppression. TUI only calls
  workspace methods and renders neutral plans.
- Never write history inside the project, follow a symlink parent, or apply a
  plan whose current hash/mode/type differs from preview. Safety snapshots are
  mandatory; every failure after mutation rolls back before returning.
- Snapshot, SQLite, verification, pruning, and restore work always runs in a
  command/background service, never Bubble Tea `Update`. Project switch and
  shutdown wait for active restore ownership.

## Restore and agent undo

- `/undo` always opens preview. Conflicts require an explicit exact choice;
  non-conflicting later text edits may use the all-hunks-applied reverse merge.
  Esc, close, or an empty selection never changes files.
- Agent undo is operation-scoped, not a message-wide workspace reset. Direct
  file tools durably record exact preimages and intended postimages before the
  first mutation; failure to persist aborts the tool. Watcher-only, editor,
  external-actor, and opaque-command changes remain workspace history but are
  never assigned to an agent. Selective undo reverses operation receipts, preserving
  pre-operation external state and failing closed across overlapping/later
  ownership.
- Agent filesystem authority is not confined to the project root. Direct tool
  mutations use compact relative keys inside the workspace and canonical
  absolute keys outside it; both receive the same operation receipt, preview,
  safety snapshot, crash recovery, and selective restore guarantees. Never
  reject or silently omit an otherwise authorized direct mutation merely because
  its path is external. Managed execution separately bounds native writes to its
  exact checkout and the owning agent's private scratch directory; Local History
  does not widen that execution or file-ownership authority.
- Restores append one hidden `<workspace_history_event>` to provider context and
  one visible canonical `history_restored` context-boundary table without
  rewriting accepted conversation prefix. The completed boundary is static,
  survives resume, closes the restore modal, and exposes its safety-snapshot
  inverse from the row context menu; never render it through `ActivityDot`.
