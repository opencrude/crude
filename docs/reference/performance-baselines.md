Canonical plan: [`docs/plans/tui-component-system-plan.md`](../plans/tui-component-system-plan.md)

## Purpose

A CPU-hammering regression in a 25fps tick-driven TUI is almost never one
function getting fatter — it is a **call-frequency regression**: cached state
re-dirtied every tick until steady state becomes a full-session re-render.
Per-call benchmarks are nearly blind to it (every individual call still looks
cheap), so the performance system is deliberately layered:

1. **Leaf gate** — per-call paint/alloc benchmarks with allocation ceilings,
   catching a function getting fatter.
2. **Scenario gate** — work-budget tests over whole frames driven through
   `app.handleTick` + `paintShellFrame`, with render work counted at pipeline
   chokepoints, catching anything that re-dirties cached state per tick.

No benchmark threshold is allowed to justify violating rendering correctness,
terminal-width invariants, component ownership, or accessibility semantics.

## Local History incremental capture

Recorded 2026-09-01 on i7-10750H, Linux, 1,000 small source files with one file
changed per snapshot:

```text
BenchmarkSnapshotAfterOneSmallEdit-12  58.3 ms/op  9.28 MB/op  73,587 allocs/op
```

The initial implementation allocated one 8 MiB chunk buffer plus the chunker
reader buffer per file (about 9 GiB/op). Small files now bypass CDC as one
content-addressed chunk and large-file CDC buffers are pooled. Wall time remains
review-only; the benchmark is retained in `localhistory/benchmark_test.go`.

## Layer 1: Leaf allocation gate

`scripts/tui_bench_gate.sh` (wired into `make bench-gate`) runs the canonical
benchmarks and fails when a result exceeds its ceiling in
**`scripts/perf_ceilings.txt`** — the machine-readable, single source of truth
for allocation ceilings:

```
# One benchmark per line: "<Name> <bytes/op> <allocs/op>"
BenchmarkEditorPaint_120x40  20000  2200
```

Rules for editing that file are documented in its header: tighten on a fix
with ~20% headroom; loosen only with a written explanation of the new cost;
verify on a quiet machine with `-count=3` (a flaky ceiling rots the gate's
credibility).

Wall-clock timing is intentionally NOT gated: CPU frequency variation across
runners makes time thresholds noise. Timing regressions are handled as a
review gate instead (see "Timing review guidance").

## Layer 2: Work budgets (`tui/perf` + `perf_budget_test.go`)

`tui/perf` carries atomic per-frame counters at the render chokepoints:
`ItemsRendered`, `LinesRendered`, `StatusRenders`, `PaneRenders`,
`CacheInvalidations`, `ItemInvalidations`, `ANSIFrames`, `ANSICells`.

`tui/viewmodel/perf_budget_test.go` pins what a frame is allowed to do:

| Test | Pins |
|------|------|
| `TestIdleTicksStayWithinWorkBudget` | 25 warm idle ticks re-render ~nothing (≤4 items / ≤64 lines outside status-row churn). |
| `TestRenderCachePersistsAfterIdleWindow` | After warm-up, every non-exempt message holds `CachedLines` (catches caches written to transient copies). |
| `TestHydrationRendersOnceThenStaysWarm` | A hydrated dead session renders each row once; mid-flight rows persisted streaming/active must be transitioned on hydration. |
| `TestTabRederivationRendersNothing` | Re-deriving the SAME agent tab per tick renders exactly zero. |
| `TestEditorAgentSwitchWorkBounded` | editor↔agent round trips render at most one session pass; steady re-derivation after the switch is zero. |
| `TestIdleWorkScalesSublinearlyWithSessionSize` | Idle work at 500 msgs ≤ 3× work at 50 msgs + constants (virtualization guard). |

Two by-design carve-outs keep the budgets honest:

- **Turn-status rows re-render every tick on purpose** (they are never
  cached). They are counted separately via `StatusRenders` and never counted
  in the item/line budgets. The seed keeps status-row count FIXED across
  session sizes so the scaling guard measures only real work. Note that
  `workspace.Conversation.insertMessage` keeps the last turn-status row pinned
  at the visual tail; the budget tests call `clearTurnTail` (a thin
  `ClearTurnStatus` wrapper) so steady state matches a completed turn.
- **Streaming rows are exempt while live** (`nilCacheExempt`): the streaming
  cursor, active thinking, and streaming tool output re-render per tick by
  necessity. The hydration test's whole point is that they must NOT stay live
  after hydration.

### Mutation verification

The four historic regressions that motivated this system were re-introduced by
hand and confirmed caught (2026-08-30):

| Regression | Test that fails | Observed churn |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Render cache written to a discarded copy | `TestRenderCachePersistsAfterIdleWindow` | 176/180 messages lost their cache |
| Per-tick tab-switch invalidation (no same-tab guard) | idle, hydration, tab, scaling tests | 4,400 items / 29,625 lines vs ≤100 budget |
| Unconditional trailing-assistant cache drop per tick | idle + hydration | 25 items/550 lines idle; 1,615 lines hydrated |
| Dead-stream cleanup skipped on hydration | `TestHydrationRendersOnceThenStaysWarm` | 50 items / 1,850 lines per idle window |

If you add a new budget test, verify it against a hand-applied regression
another time this happens — a budget tool that has never caught its bug is
cargo cult.

## Layer 3: Runtime sentinel

Live runs can be watched for the same signature by setting
`CRUDE_PERF_LOG=<path>` before launching crude. Every 32 ticks
(`SentinelTick` from `handleTick`) it samples the `tui/perf` counters; if a
window exceeds the work budget while the app is idle, it appends one throttled
line (`crude-perf: idle window exceeds work budget ... top=<site>`) to the
file. The top site comes from the opt-in probe attribution, so a diagnosis
session usually starts, not ends, with that file:

```bash
CRUDE_PERF_LOG=/tmp/crude-perf.log ./crude --resume <session-id>
```

Input and streaming mark the app "active" and suppress warnings — repaints
during interaction are the product working, not a degenerate loop. `main.go`
discards slog to protect the TUI surface, which is why the sentinel writes
directly to the file. For interactive CPU profiling use
`CRUDE_PPROF=":6060"` (pprof endpoint in `main.go`), then
`go tool pprof` against `curl localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=10`
captures.

Record environment information with `go version`, `go env GOOS GOARCH
GOVERSION`, `uname -srmo`, and `lscpu`. For before/after comparisons capture
both revisions with the same command and compare with `benchstat`; never
compare across power modes without noting it.

## Recorded Results (2026-08-30 capture)

| Benchmark | Observed time range (ns) | Bytes/op | Allocs/op |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------|-----------|
| `DemoGalleryPaint_80x24` | 22,006-23,064 | 280 | 31 |
| `DemoGalleryPaint_120x40` | 34,915-37,772 | 280 | 31 |
| `DemoGalleryHandleKeyEditCycle` | 262-265 | 32 | 1 |
| `Blit_80x24` | 5,219-5,354 | 0 | 0 |

| `FlattenZOrder_Nested` | 766-789 | 2,168 | 8 |
| `FullRender_80x24` | 75,433-76,777 | 8,255 | 4 |
| `GenerateANSI_80x24` | 38,919-41,954 | 8,231 | 2 |
| `EditorPaint_80x24` | 112,558-113,689 | 4,288 | 633 |
| `EditorPaint_120x40` | 249,929-257,167 | 7,952 | 1,144 |
| `EditorPaint_LargeFile_120x40` | 253,526-256,495 | 7,952 | 1,144 |
| `EditorScrollRepaint_120x40` | 249,929-253,725 | 7,952 | 1,144 |
| `ChatStreamPaint_80x24` | 106,946-109,622 | 6,747 | 122 |
| `ChatStreamPaint_120x40` | 231,827-235,747 | 16,412 | 226 |
| `BenchmarkIdleTick_200Msgs` | 248,317-279,222 | 101,345 | 506 |
| `BenchmarkTabRederive_80Msgs` | 187,740-193,630 | 47,535 | 331-332 |

`DemoGalleryHandleKeyEditCycle` measures one insertion plus Backspace per op
(keeps input length constant). The scenario benches measure a full
`handleTick` + shell-frame paint, not a single render call: `IdleTick_200Msgs`
pumps idle frames against a hydrated 200-message mixed-role session;
`TabRederive_80Msgs` re-derives the same agent tab per frame.

**Editor allocation fix note:** the four `EditorPaint`/`EditorScrollRepaint`
benches used to exceed their old byte ceilings (13,520B at 80x24, 25,152B at
120x40) because the per-frame steady path re-materialized the line string
(`string(b)` before the geometry cache check) and rebuilt the grapheme-cluster
slice on every call. `lineGeomInfo` and `lineRenderInfo` now serve cache hits
without allocating (~-68% bytes/op); the ceilings were tightened to the new
measured values +20% headroom.

## Timing review guidance

Not machine-enforced; a merge reviewer should ask for a benchstat comparison
when measured time moves materially:

| Benchmark | Expected upper time |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `DemoGalleryPaint_80x24` | 45,000 ns/op |
| `DemoGalleryPaint_120x40` | 70,000 ns/op |
| `DemoGalleryHandleKeyEditCycle` | 750 ns/op |
| `Blit_80x24` | 15,000 ns/op |
| `WriteString_Line` | 5,000 ns/op |
| `FlattenZOrder_Nested` | 1,500 ns/op |
| `FullRender_80x24` | 175,000 ns/op |
| `GenerateANSI_80x24` | 70,000 ns/op |
| `EditorPaint_80x24` | 250,000 ns/op |
| `EditorPaint_120x40` | 400,000 ns/op |
| `EditorPaint_LargeFile_120x40` | 400,000 ns/op |
| `EditorScrollRepaint_120x40` | 400,000 ns/op |
| `ChatStreamPaint_80x24` | 250,000 ns/op |
| `ChatStreamPaint_120x40` | 500,000 ns/op |
| `BenchmarkIdleTick_200Msgs` | 500,000 ns/op |
| `BenchmarkTabRederive_80Msgs` | 400,000 ns/op |

## Interpretation Rules

1. Compare like-for-like benchmark names, terminal sizes, Go versions, and CPU
   power modes.
2. Treat allocation growth as a regression unless the change documents why.
   The ceilings live in `scripts/perf_ceilings.txt`; there is no second list
   in this file to drift out of sync.
3. Treat a repeated timing increase above 15% as requiring investigation even
   under the expected-time ceiling.
4. Any new steady-state render path needs a work-budget counterpart (or an
   explicit carve-out in `nilCacheExempt` / the budget constants) — not just a
   leaf benchmark.
5. Do not optimize by bypassing `docs/reference/terminal-width.md`, Surface
   compositing, theme tokens, component semantics, or proper invalidation.
6. Add a benchmark when introducing a materially new hot path such as
   variable-height virtualization, root Host paint, or product-screen
   component composition.

## Known Baseline Costs

- Turn-status rows re-render every tick by design (never cached) and are
  counted separately (`StatusRenders`), not budgeted.
- `buildGlobalPaneLineMap` (chatprojection renderer) rebuilds a global
  line map over all messages per frame — O(N) retained when it could be
  per-pane/virtualized. Measured acceptable at current session sizes; revisit
  if the scenario benches move.
- `Present()` regenerates a full ANSI frame (`GenerateANSI(c.back)`) whenever
  any damage exists — no dirty-rect stripping. Counted via `ANSIFrames` /
  `ANSICells` so a change in frame cost is visible in the sentinel.
- Hydration is O(N²) in the current load path (session messages are read and
  re-inserted per row through the append path) and the session DB is loaded
  twice on resume. Both are startup-bound, not frame-bound.
- The remaining steady editor-path allocations (~633-1,144/op) are per-cell
  `cell.NewCell` construction and per-line `PieceTable.Line` buffers; further
  reduction wants a retained line-paint model, not micro-fixes.
